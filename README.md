# Birthday-Reminder

This is a simple React application that displays a list of people's birthdays. It allows users to view the names, ages, and images of people celebrating their birthdays on the current date.You can also click on the "Clear All" button to clear the list of birthdays.

MAIN OBJECTIVE is to cover basic react concepts such as:

1.In React, props (short for properties) are used to pass data from parent components to child components. In this application, props are used to send the list of people's birthdays from the App component (parent) to the List component (child).

2.React components can have state, which represents data that can change over time. The useState hook is used to add state to functional components. In this application, the App component uses the useState hook to manage the list of people's birthdays.

3.The map method is used to iterate over arrays and create a new array of elements based on the original array. In this application, the map method is used in the List component to dynamically render a list of people's birthdays
